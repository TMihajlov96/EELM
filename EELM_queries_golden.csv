What is biosphere?,"Biosphere is one of the layers of the Earth. It is a biotic segment of the Earth, meaning that includes all life forms"
What is fossilisation?,"Fossilisation is the process of parts of a dead animal or plant being turned into a part of a sediment, and thereby preserved. Normally, fossilisation preserves only the harder parts of an organism. Some kind of protective layer, often mud or sand, less frequently ice, tar, volcanic ash or tree sap, needs to build up over an organism relatively rapidly if fossilisation is to occur."
"In the context of geology and rock formaiton, what is degradation?",Degradation the process in which a rock is being broken down as a result of disintegration. It is a part of the rock cycle.
What is metamorphism?,"Metamorphism is the process in which rock’s chemical, mineral, and structural features change so as to adapt to a set of new conditions that usually come about as a consequence of weathering or cementation, and are different from those from which the rock originates. Heat and pressure are two important agents of metamorphism. Pressure, in fact, should be divided into two distinct agents – pressure and stress – with chemically active fluids as a final agent. All these agents are usually involved in the metamorphic process, although to different degrees depending on the specific environment."
What is chemical weathering?,"Chemical weathering implies transformation of rocks through chemical reactions when exposed to air or water containing dissolved elements. Chemical weathering occurs when the chemical structure of minerals is broken down or changed through a complex process of reactions which occur when rock is exposed to air or – more frequently – moderately acidic water, most often in the form of acid rain."
What is sporopollenin?,"Sporopollenin is a substance that is both strong and very stable chemically. It iis a biological polymer, which is a major component of the outer walls of plant spores and pollen grains. "
What is detritus?,"Detritus are pieces of waste material left after something has been used or destroyed debris, remains, remnants, and rubble. Organic detritus, such as fallen leaves, largely constitutes horizon, the upper band in a soil profile."
What is topography?,"Topography is a configuration of a land surface, or any part of the Earth’s surface, including its position and features"
What is beryl?,"Beryl is a family of minerals made up of a silicate of beryllium and aluminum. When a mineral is pure, its colorless are green, blue, or
pink. When it is not pure, it is coloured yellow. One example of a mineral from a beryl family is emerald."
What is a metamorphic rock?,"Metamorphic rock is a type of rock that occurs when the preexisting rock converts into a new type of rock due to increasing pressure and temperature. Metamorphic rock forms when the chemical, mineralogical and / or textural composition of a parent rock, or pre-existing, rock undergoes alteration under the influence of agents such as heat or pressure. The parent rock – which can be sedimentary, igneous, or another form of metamorphic rock – remains solid throughout the metamorphic process In part because of the continued solid state of the rock during metamorphism, the basic chemical composition remains the same, even though the individual chemical elements within the rock may undergo change. Consequently, metamorphic rocks will share some characteristics with the parent rock."
What are fossil fuels?,"Fossil fuel is a term used for any class of hydrocarbon-materials that can be used as a source of energy. Fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) are repositories of the solar energy which radiated the earth millennia ago. While all three form from a matrix of organic matter, the original form of the matter, its location, and its interaction with various forces during diagenesis determine which of the fossil fuels is formed. Oil and gas originate in microscopic marine phytoplankton and bacteria which, trapped most usually in shales, release organic compounds into the surrounding matter, becoming part of the shale, and then largely through interaction with heat, transforming into oil and gas."
What is a mineral district?,Mineral district is a collection of mineral deposits found in relative proximity to the area where the geological process that created them were active.
What is till?,"Till is a form of a glacial drift. It is a group of usually unconsolidated sediments that are disposed by glacial action, without groundwater intervening. They are generally a mix of randomly sized fragments and clasts, as glaciers can carry and deposit objects of vastly differing sizes and weights together, most frequently with larger fragments embedded in a matrix of finer grained sedimentary material. Very often, the individual component rocks of a till will differ from the underlying substrate – any such component is known as an erratic – and can be huge and extremely heavy. Erratics can also have been moved up to hundreds of kilometres from their point of origin."
Explain what global warming is and why it happens.,"Global warming is an increase in global temperature due to various factors such as increased carbon dioxide emission and pollution, with a potentially catastrophic outcome"
What is an igneous rock?,Igneous rock is a rock formed as a result of the cooling and crystallisation of magma. It can also be formed as a result of magma acting on an already existing sedimentary rock.
What is erosion?,"Erosion is the process by which the end results of weathering are moved and deposited around the globe through interaction with water, ice, wind or gravity."
What is a gemstone?,"Gemstone is a mineral, rock, or other natural material recognized for its beauty, durability, and value. When cut and polished, it is used for jewelry and other ornamentsgem, fine gem, precious stone, semi-precious stone. Gemstones are formed in gemstone deposits, which can be primary or secondary. The majority of gemstone mining and exploitation takes place in secondary deposits."
What is a glacier?,"Glacier is a large mass of ice formed on land as a result of snow chrystalization. For a glacier to be formed, three conditions are necessary - a climate should be sufficiently cold that some winter snow persists throughout the entire year; theere should be a significant accumulation of snow; a location should not be neither steeply sloped, so that snow is not dissipated by avalanches, and nor exposed to prevailing winds, so that the snow does not blow away. A glacier may be divided into two sections, or zones – the accumulation zone, and the ablation zone."
"In the context of geology, what is inclusion?","Inclusion is any material trapped inside a rock that forms around it. Both sedimentary strata and igneous intrusions may contain inclusions: in the former case, pebbles of the igneous rock on which the sediment settles, in the latter xenoliths, or fragments of other rocks. In both cases, the inclusions must be older than the rock containing them, as they were incorporated into that rock as it was forming."
What is a hypothesis?,"Hypothesis is an assumption resting on previous knowledge, but has not yet been proven true or false."
What is groundwater?,"Groundwater is fresh water stored under the soil surface, in cracks and spaces in soil, sand and rock. It is water that lays up to approximately 750m below the surface of the Earth. Ground water, situated in the upper layer, can move relatively easily because of the porosity and permeability of the medium, and is generally considered to be of use to living organisms."
What is a debris?,Debris a collection of fragments of rock. 
What is bedrock?,"Bedrock is a solid rock that is laying under unconsolidated mater. The bedrock of the Earth – and indeed of a planet such as Mars, and the Moon – is covered with a layer of weathered fragments of the underlying bedrock, which is known as regolith. "
What is weathering?,"Weathering is the process of rock erosion through mechanical disintegration or chemical decomposition of the rock material due to exposure to water, air, and organic matter. Weathering can be separated into two distinct processes: mechanical (also physical) weathering and chemical weathering."
What is a zircon?,"Zircon is a transparent or brown, green, blue, or grey mineral consisting of zirconium silicate and occurring in the form of prismatic crystals. "
What is subsidence?,"Subsidence is a sudden or gradual sinking of the ground, due to geologic processes (e.g. thawing, groundwater depletion, seismic activity, etc.) or man’s activity (e.g. mining)."
What is exploitation?,"Exploitation is an act of taking or using something for gain, and often to its limitsprofiteering, taking advantage, abuse, appropriation. "
"In the context of geology, what is a fault?","Fault is a fracture or a set of fractures in Earth’s crust that occurs when stress is applied and along which there is a displacement. When tectonic plates are moving in parallel directions, rather than converging or diverging, a transform fault is formed. In this case, two plates slide against each other, causing their edges to grind and abrade as they do so, generating friction which can cause earthquakes. The San Andreas Fault, where the North American Plate is moving to the south west, and the Pacific Plate to the north west, is probably the most famous example of a transform fault."
What is lustre?,"Lustre is the manner in which the surface of a mineral reacts to light, or its ability to reflect light. This is dependent upon the refractive index, which can be non-metallic, semi-metallic or metallic. In short, minerals such as gold and silver have the appearance of metals and a metallic shine, while others, such as sulphur and gypsum, do not shine like a metal, and are designated non-metallic. A range of adjectives can be used to further describe non-metallic lustre: earthy or dull, greasy, silky or waxy, pearly, and vitreous.  surface of a mineral reacts to light, or its ability to reflect light."
"In the context of geology, what is a cavity?","Cavity is a small hole in a limestone cave, or in cavernous lava. "
"In the context of geology, what is suspension?",Suspension is the state of particles that are mixed in a substance but not dissolved. In the context of 
What is a borehole?,Borehole a deep hole that has a small diameter. Drilling of artificial boreholes is one of the tecniques used to preserve thermal water.
What is a coastline?,"Coastline is a line that separates land from a body of water, e.g., sea, ocean, or lake. "
What is foliation?,Foliation in geology refers to repetitive layering in metamorphic rocks. It pertains to the structural or textural characteristics of a rock.
What is a microfossil?,"Microfossil refers to a small remains of animals or plants preserved in rock and sediments. Microfossils typically measure less than a millimetre, therefore requiring micropalaeontologists to use microscopes to study the organisms to determine their morphology and characteristics. Occurring most frequently in material from marine deposits, microfossils have also been found in both fresh and brackish water, and sedimentary deposits on land. The majority are organic microfossils, followed by pollen and spores from vascular plants."
What is a magma chamber?,"Magma chamber is a reservoir of magma close to the top layer of lithosphere, from which volcanic materials are obtained.  "
What is micropalaeontology?,"Micropalaeontology is the study of small, microscopic remains of animals and plants. Micropalaeontology explores microfossils, which typically measure less than a millimetre, to determine their morphology and characteristics. "
What are eukaryotic organisms?,The term eukaryotic organisms pertains to complex protoplasmic life-forms with a vesicular nucleus and various cytoplasmic organelles. 
What is lithosphere?,"Lithosphere refers to an outer rigid layer or the Earth which consists of the crust and the uppermost part of the mantle. Lithosphere mostly consists of peridotite (a very dense rock containing high levels of the mineral olivine), basalt and granite – all igneous rocks. Granite and basalt generally form the crust, while the top of the upper part of the mantle is largely peridotite."
What is a sedimentary rock?,"Sedimentary rock a type of rock formed by accumulation and cementation of transported sediments by means of water, wind, glacier, or gravity. "
What is seismology?,"Seismology is a science studying earthquakes and the structure of the Earth, by using both natural and artificially created seismic waves. Seismology not only allows the prediction of earthquake hazards, and the damage they may cause, but has also led to a greater understanding of the composition of the Earth. "
What is seafloor?,"Seafloor is a land at the bottom of the oceanseabed, sea floor"
What is permeability?,"Permeability is a quality of being able to let liquid or gas pass throughporousness, penetrability, receptiveness. It is one of two basic necessary characteristics of reservoir rock, whereby the second is porosity."
What is a rift?,Rift refers to a narrow opening in the groundcrack.
What is a slope?,"Slope is a naturally or artificially elevated surface, usually referring to a side of a hill or mountainslant. Slope has a significant effect on soil formation. "
"In the context of geology, what is a depression?",Depression an area that is lower than the surrounding environmentpit.
What is a streak (or smear) of a mineral?,"Streak or a smear is a trace that a mineral leaves on a surface. A mineral’s streak is obtained by rubbing a sample against a streak plate, usually an unglazed porcelain tile While the colour of a mineral may vary, as demonstrated above, the colour of a streak, or smear, usually does not, making this a much more reliable diagnostic property than simple observation.
"
How are sedimentary rocks formed?,"Sedimentary rock is formed from fragments (clasts) of pre-existing rocks, material resulting from weathering processes, precipitated material and organic material, and tends to be laid down in beds of sediment."
How does water change throughout the hydrological cycle?,"The hydrological cycle of the earth is the sum total of all processes in which water moves from the land and ocean surface to the atmosphere and back in form of precipitation. The hydrological cycle the representation of a continuous, circular movement of water through the atmosphere, where the physical state of water alters as it flows through the cycle."
